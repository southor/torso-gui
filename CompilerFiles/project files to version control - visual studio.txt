------------------------------------
Visual Studio:

cpp
filters
h
ico
manifest
rc
rc2
sln
txt
vcxproj

Generally, you should version all files necessary to build the project. Automatically generated files should not be archived imho.

------------------------------------
Visual Studio:

Yes:

    cpp: source code
    filters: project file
    h: source code
    ico: resource
    rc: resource script
    rc2: resource script
    sln: project file
    txt: project element
    vcxproj: project file

No:

    aps: last resource editor state
    exe: build result
    idb: build state
    ipch: build helper
    lastbuildstate: build helper
    lib: build result. Can be 3rd party
    log: build log
    manifest: build helper. Can be written yourself.
    obj: build helper
    pch: build helper
    pdb: build result
    res: build helper
    sdf: intellisense dbase
    tlog: build log
    user: debug settings. Do preserve if just one dev or custom debug settings

Several of these are iffy because they can both be auto-generated and maintained yourself. And there are several more that don't appear in your list. Primarily pay attention to the location of the file. If it is in your solution or project directory then it's highly likely you want to check it in. In the Debug or Release subdirectories then highly unlikely. Build + Clean removes a lot of the noise files. And of course: check-in, rename the project directory, check-out and verify that it builds.
